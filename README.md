# Camera Points ![Plugin Installs](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.runelite.net/pluginhub/shields/installs/plugin/Camera-Points)

This plugin allows you to save and load your camera zoom and/or a compass direction.<br>
Since it is not allowed to have presets for camera yaw/pitch/position, only these two features are supported by this plugin.<br>
However, this plugin does work with the "expand inner/outer zoom limit" and "Preserve pitch on compass look" settings from the default "Camera" plugin.

## Settings
When "Disable hotkeys while typing" is enabled, camera points will not be loaded while you are typing in a chatbox.

## Sidebar
You can manage all your saved camera points in the sidebar.<br>
By clicking the green + you can add a new camera point, this will automatically get your current zoom value. You can then rename it if you like.<br><br>
